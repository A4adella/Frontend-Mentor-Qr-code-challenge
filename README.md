## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

First and Foremost I centered a div!, The Achilles heel of a new-bie developer. Using the Flex box display property, I was able to successfully structure the layout of the Qr code as displayed in the exercise.

Here are snippets of my code I'm proud of:

```html
</a >. Coded by <a href="#">Adella Emmanuel</a>
```
```css
.Flex-container {
  display: flex;
  width: 320px;
  height: 450px;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border-radius: 10px;
  background-color: white;
  margin: 50px 100px 50px 100px;

 #QR{
    width: 289px;
    height: 289px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 5px;
 }
}
```



### Continued development

Concepts I need to improve on as I progress are:
-Algorithim
-Styling flexbox
